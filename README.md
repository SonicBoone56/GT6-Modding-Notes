# GT6-Modding-Notes
Some helpful notes for myself and other people looking into modding Gran Turismo 6. This goes beyond Nenkai's Modding Hub and specializes in strictly GT6 files and data.

#Intro
While GT6 uses many of the same types of file types and features many of the same tables in its databases, the way it uses them can be very different than previous titles. Nenkai's Modding Hub mostly focuses on and is based on GT4 specifications, which GT5, and to a lesser extent, GTPSP shares a lot in common with. GT6 is the weird middle child between GT4 and GTSport. It uses standard SQL database files instead of proprietary ones, plus it uses a knockoff of JavaScript for all its scripting, as opposed to whatever the previous titles used. GT Sport uses very similar formats to GT6, however I've not attempted GT Sport modding since I don't own a PS4. GT7 switched to using Swift for all its databases and scripting.
